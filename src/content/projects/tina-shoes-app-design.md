## TINA SHOES - Premium E-commerce Mobile App Design

**TINA SHOES** is a UI/UX design exercise focused on creating a mobile application for a niche, high-end footwear brand. The design prioritizes visual storytelling around product quality (e.g., Italian leather, handmade craftsmanship) while delivering a highly intuitive and secure purchasing experience.

<br>

This project was a design exercise focused on applying UI/UX principles to the critical path of an e-commerce platform.

<br>

##### Problem:

Many premium product e-commerce apps fail to translate the brand's quality and aesthetic into a compelling mobile experience. The challenge was to create a design that simultaneously communicated luxury and made the buying process fast and effortless.

<br>

##### Solution:

Design a visually rich mobile application with a dark, sophisticated color palette to reflect the premium nature of the shoes. The core user flow was streamlined to ensure users could navigate from product discovery to purchase confirmation with minimal friction.

<br>
<br>

### Brief & Task Flow

## Design & Key Features

The design centered around making the product the hero while ensuring clarity in navigation and checkout steps.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Key Screens Showcase

The design process resulted in high-fidelity mockups for all core e-commerce screens: Homepage, Product Details, Checkout, and Confirmation.

<br>

##### 1. Homepage & Navigation

The **Homepage** uses large, dramatic imagery to immediately convey the brand's aesthetic. The design includes a clear search function and a hamburger menu for accessing account and cart details.

<br>
<br>

##### 2. Product Detail Page (Storytelling)

The **Product Detail** page goes beyond standard specifications. It integrates **visual storytelling elements** (like 'Italian Leather' and 'Handmade' cards) to reinforce the perceived value and quality of the footwear, addressing the problem of translating luxury online.

<br>

<br>
<br>

##### 3. Secure & Streamlined Checkout

The checkout flow is kept simple, requiring essential details for payment and delivery on a single, clean screen. This design minimizes steps to **reduce cart abandonment**. I included a small 'i' tooltip button that users can click to see helpful information like "3 digits from the back of your card" for the CVV field, making the checkout process more user-friendly.

<br>
<br>

##### 4. Confirmation Experience

The final **Confirmation** screen is designed to provide immediate, positive feedback. It features a map for a visual delivery tracker and a clear "Congratulations!" message, enhancing post-purchase satisfaction.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### High-Fidelity Prototype

The final prototype showcases the full visual design with smooth animations between pages to enhance user interactions and create a more engaging, polished experience.

<br>

## Takeaways & Next Steps

##### What I Learned

This project highlighted the importance of **visual hierarchy** in communicating brand value. By using a dark theme and large, high-quality photography, the luxury positioning of the products was immediately established. The iterative process for the confirmation state reinforced that even small interactions can significantly impact a user's feeling of security and satisfaction.

<br>

##### Next Steps

Future work would involve **A/B testing** different product card layouts on the listing page to optimize click-through rates, and conducting a **full usability study** on the checkout process to benchmark the time-to-completion.
