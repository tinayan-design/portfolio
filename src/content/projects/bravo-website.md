## Bravo Tutors Responsive Website Design
**Bravo Tutors** responsive website is designed to provide a seamless tutoring service experience across all devices. The website's main goal is to help parents easily find and book qualified tutors while ensuring optimal user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

<br>

**Problem**: The existing Bravo Tutors website lacked responsive design, had poor conversion rates, and provided inconsistent user experience across different devices.

<br>

**Solution**: Design a fully responsive, modern website with optimized user flows, clear call-to-actions, and device-specific optimizations that enhance the booking experience and increase conversion rates across all platforms.

<br>
<br>

## Research

**Research Summary**

Based on my initial assumptions that the main challenge was simply making the website mobile-friendly, I conducted user analytics analysis and competitive research. The research revealed deeper issues with the entire user experience, including poor navigation structure, slow loading times, and ineffective conversion funnels.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Key Pain Points

<br>

**Problem Statement**

Sarah Mitchell is a busy working mother who needs to quickly find and book qualified tutors for her children using her various devices throughout the day, because she requires flexibility to manage tutoring arrangements from anywhere, whether at work on desktop or on-the-go with her mobile phone.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Early Concepts

##### User Journey Mapping
I created a cross-device user journey map of Sarah's experience to identify potential pain points and opportunities for improvement. This helped outline the steps from initial website visit to tutor booking completion, revealing key moments where responsive design could optimize the experience.

## Design, Test, Iterate

### Paper Wireframes

I began by sketching responsive wireframes for key pages, keeping the user's needs for cross-device consistency and efficient booking process in mind. My goal was to create a seamless experience that worked equally well on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

<br>

##### Screen Size Variations

Based on users access the website across different devices to complete their tutor bookings, I started to work on designs for additional screen sizes to ensure the site would be fully responsive.

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Digital Wireframes

Moving to digital wireframes helped me visualize how the responsive design would address user pain points across different screen sizes. Key pages included:
<br>
<br>

##### Homepage Design

- **Desktop Navigation:** Full horizontal navigation with search functionality
- **Hero Section:** Easy browsing through the tutors carousel of images
- **Tutor Showcase:** Grid layout featuring top-rated tutors

<br>

<br>
<br>

##### Tutor Profile Page

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### Tablet and Mobile Screen Sizes

### Low-Fidelity Prototype

I connected all of the screens involved in the primary user flow of finding a tutor and make an appointment. In order to create a comprehensive low-fidelity prototype, I had received feedback on my designs from my co-workers about spacing, placement of buttons and input fields. I implemented several suggestions in places that addressed user pain points.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Usability Testing

**Methodology**

I conducted unmoderated usability testing with 5 participants across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) to validate the responsive design and identify areas for improvement.

<br>

### Key Findings

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Refining the Design
Based on the insights from usability testing, I made several strategic changes to improve the cross-device user experience:

<br>

##### Improved Scheduling Design
- **Before:** Unclear how to select booking time slot with selected tutor
- **After:** Drop-down menu design with clear available time slots and visual appealing design

<br>

<br>
<br>

##### Clear Booking Summary Showcase
- **Before:** Unclear about booking details that caused confusion
- **After:** Comprehensive summary card at right hand side indicating booking information

<br>

<br>
<br>

##### Tablet and Mobile Size

I included additional screen sizes in my mockups based on my earlier wireframes. As users book tutors from a variety of devices, it is important to optimize the booking experience for different device sizes, such as tablet and mobile.

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

### High-Fidelity Prototype

The final high-fidelity prototype incorporated all user feedback and responsive design improvements while maintaining consistent branding across all devices. The result was a polished, cross-device experience that successfully addressed all identified usability issues.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Takeaways & Next steps

##### Key Results

Users found the final responsive design to be intuitive and consistent across all devices, providing a seamless booking experience with excellent performance. The improvements successfully addressed all major usability issues identified in testing, resulting in significant improvements in conversion rates and user satisfaction.

<br>

##### What I Learned

This project reinforced the importance of designing for the full spectrum of user contexts and devices. The most important lesson was that responsive design is not just about making things fit different screen sizes, but about optimizing the entire user experience for how people actually use different devices throughout their day.

<br>

##### Next Steps

To continue improving the Bravo Tutors website experience, I would conduct cross-device user journey testing on how users move between devices during their booking process.
