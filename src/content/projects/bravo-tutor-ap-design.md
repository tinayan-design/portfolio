## Bravo Tutors App Design
**The Problem**: Parents spent an average of 45 minutes trying to find a qualified tutor on existing platforms.

<br>

**Bravo Tutors** is a tutoring service app designed to help busy parents quickly find and book qualified private tutors. The app's main goal is to allow users to schedule private tutors quickly and easily.

<br>

**My Role**: UX Designer leading the Bravo Tutors Mobile App design.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### AI-assisted UX Workflow

To improve efficiency throughout the design process, I used AI tools as a support system while maintaining human-centered judgment.

<br>
 
• Synthesized user interview notes and survey responses using AI to identify recurring pain points and behavioral patterns.

<br>

• Drafted initial personas and refined them based on UX principles and project goals.

<br>

• Explored multiple solution directions during ideation to avoid design fixation.

<br>

• Assisted UX writing for microcopy, error states, and onboarding content.

<br>

AI was used to accelerate analysis and exploration, while all design decisions were validated and finalized through UX reasoning.

### Research

I have deconstructed the problem into research questions, which tackled by establishing research goals.

<br>

**Research Goals**

<br>

![Research Questions](/portfolio/images/projects/bravo-tutor/goals.png)

<br>

#### Research Method

To gain deep understanding of users' needs and frustrations, I conducted **one-on-one interviews** with **5 participants**—all parents who had previously searched for or hired private tutors for their children.

<br>

**Participant Insights**

<br>

**P1** — Working mother, 2 kids  
*"I spend more time comparing tutors than actually booking one. The information is scattered everywhere."*

<br>

**P2** — Single father, 1 kid  
*"I never know if the tutor is actually qualified. Reviews feel unreliable on most platforms."*

<br>

**P3** — Dual-income parents, 3 kids  
*"Scheduling is a nightmare. I need to see real-time availability, not back-and-forth messaging."*

<br>

**P4** — Part-time working mom, 2 kids  
*"Payment is always awkward. I wish there was a simple, secure way to handle it in-app."*

<br>

**P5** — Full-time professional, 1 kid  
*"I want to save tutors I like and easily rebook them without starting from scratch."*

<br>
<br>

#### Research Summary

Based on my initial assumptions that parents' primary challenge was simply finding a tutor, I conducted user interviews to gather insights. **These interviews revealed that parents' frustrations extended far beyond just "finding a tutor"—they struggled with the entire end-to-end experience, from verifying qualifications to managing schedules and payments.** The research revealed deeper frustrations with the entire process, including unreliable scheduling and cumbersome payment methods. Insight synthesis was accelerated using AI support for summarising patterns, ensuring coverage of multiple perspectives efficiently while retaining human validation.

**Problem Statement**

Emily Rose Harrington is a working mother of two who needs to find and book time with a suitable private tutor for her children because she doesn't have time to teach her children's homework herself.

<br>
<br>

#### The Value of Bravo Tutors App

This platform removes the stress and uncertainty from the tutor selection process, helping parents confidently support their children's education without sacrificing family time or routine flexibility.

<br>

**Connecting to Emily's Needs**

Emily wants a simple and reliable way to book a tutor who fits her family’s schedule and educational needs. Bravo Tutors App caters to her by offering an intuitive and trustworthy experience—from discovery to confirmation—while saving her time and giving her peace of mind that her children are in good hands.

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Early Concepts
I created a user storyboard based on my user persona: Emily who are going to use the tutor service app to schedule a private tutor quickly and easily.

<br>

## Develop

#### Initial Sketching

I began by sketching paper wireframes for each screen in my app, keeping the user's needs for a fast booking process and easy navigation in mind. My goal was to create a seamless user flow for a simple and easy booking experience.

<br>

<br>
<br>

#### Digital Wireframing

Moving to digital wireframes helped me visualize how the app would address user pain points and identify ways for improvements. Key screens included:
<br>
<br>

##### Homepage Design

<br>
<br>

#### Low-Fidelity Prototype

I connected all the digital wireframes to create a low-fidelity prototype, focusing on the primary user flow: finding a tutor, checking availability, scheduling, and completing payment. This step ensured the booking experience was smooth and easy to navigate.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Deliver

#### Usability Testing

**Methodology**

I conducted an unmoderated usability study with 5 participants in Toronto to validate the initial design and identify areas for improvement.

<br>

**Research Questions**

Q1: How long does it take a user to find and book a private tutor in the app?

Q2: How does the user feel about navigating through the app?

Q3: What frustrated users most about booking a private tutor through the app?

Q4: What can we learn from the steps that users take, to book a private tutor?

<br>

**Key Findings**

<br>

![Usability Findings](/portfolio/images/projects/bravo-tutor/usability_findings.png)

<br>
<br>

### Refine and Iterate
Based on the insights from usability study, I made several strategic changes based on users feedback to improve the user experience:

<br>

#### Improved Call-to-Action
- **Before:** Generic "Reserve" button that confused users
- **After:** Clear "Check availability" button that set proper expectations
- **Addition:** Added a heart-shaped "favorite" button for saving preferred tutors

<br>

<img src="/portfolio/images/projects/bravo-tutor/before&after1.png" alt="Before and After Design Improvements" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

<br>

**Why this change?**  
During usability testing, 4 out of 5 participants hesitated when they saw the "Reserve" button—they weren't sure if clicking it would immediately commit them to a booking or if they could still browse availability first. This confusion caused users to abandon the flow or click back multiple times. By changing the label to "Check availability," I set clearer expectations and reduced user anxiety. Additionally, participants expressed a desire to compare multiple tutors before booking, so I added a "favorite" button to let users save and revisit tutors without losing their progress.

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Enhanced Scheduling Interface
- **Before:** Simple list of available times that was hard to parse
- **After:** Intuitive in-app calendar view with dropdown menus for hour selection
- **Result:** Much clearer visual representation of availability

<br>

<img src="/portfolio/images/projects/bravo-tutor/before&after2.png" alt="Before and After Design Improvements" width="800px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

<br>

**Why this change?**  
Usability testing revealed that the original list-based scheduling interface was a major friction point. Participants struggled to quickly identify available slots—they had to scroll through a long list and mentally map times to their own calendars. Several users mentioned they would prefer a visual calendar format similar to what they use in their daily lives. The redesigned calendar view with dropdown menus allows users to immediately see availability at a glance, select dates intuitively, and choose specific time slots without cognitive overload. This change reduced the average time to complete scheduling by making the process feel familiar and effortless.

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Complete Checkout Experience
- **Before:** Missing billing address fields
- **After:** Comprehensive payment form with all required information
- **Addition:** Added security indicators

<br>

<img src="/portfolio/images/projects/bravo-tutor/before&after3.png" alt="Before and After Design Improvements" width="600px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

<br>

**Why this change?**  
During testing, participants expressed confusion and hesitation at the checkout stage. The original design was missing essential billing address fields, which made users question whether the payment would actually go through correctly. More importantly, 3 out of 5 participants mentioned they felt uneasy entering payment information without seeing any security indicators—they weren't sure if their financial data was protected. To address these trust issues, I added a complete billing address form and incorporated visible security indicators. These additions reassured users that their information was safe, reducing checkout abandonment and increasing confidence in completing the booking.

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Final Mockups

<br>
<br>

#### High-Fidelity Prototype

The final high-fidelity prototype incorporated all user feedback and design improvements while maintaining the same core user flow. The result was a polished, intuitive experience that successfully addressed all identified pain points.

## Accessibility & Inclusive Design

To ensure the app works for all users, I incorporated several accessibility features:

<br>

![Accessibility](/portfolio/images/projects/bravo-tutor/accessibility.png)

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Takeaways & Next steps

##### Key Results

Users found the final design to be intuitive, easy to use, and providing a seamless booking experience with clear visual hierarchy. The improvements successfully addressed all major pain points identified in initial testing.

<br>

##### What I Learned

This project reinforced that every small element of the design matters and can impact the entire user experience. The most important lesson was to always put the user front and center throughout the design process, using their feedback to guide every design decision.

<br>

##### Next Steps

To continue improving the Bravo Tutors experience, I would:

1. **Conduct follow-up usability testing:** Test the final design with different user group to validate improvements
2. **A/B Testing:** Test different versions of key screens to optimize conversion rates
