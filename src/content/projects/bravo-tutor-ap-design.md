## Bravo Tutors App Design
**Bravo Tutors** is a tutoring service app designed to help busy parents quickly find and book qualified private tutors. The app's main goal is to allow users to schedule private tutors quickly and easily.

<br>

**Problem**:  Existing mobile apps for finding tutors have complicated designs, are inefficient for browsing and have confusing checkout processes. 

<br>

**Solution**:  Design a user-friendly Bravo Tutors app with clear navigation and a reliable booking experience that allows users to find and book a tutor efficiently.

<br>
<br>

## Research
Upon choosing this prompt, I have deconstructed the prompt into research questions, which tackled by establishing research goals.

<br>

**Research Goals**

<br>
<br>

**Research Summary**

Based on my initial assumptions that parents' primary challenge was simply finding a tutor, I conducted user interviews to gather insights. The research revealed deeper frustrations with the entire process, including unreliable scheduling and cumbersome payment methods.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Key Pain Points

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Persona
I used these insights to create user persona, which informed the design of a streamlined, all-in-one platform to address these core user needs.

<br>
<br>

**Problem Statement**

Emily Rose Harrington is a working mother of two who needs to find and book time with a suitable private tutor for her children because she doesn't have time to teach her children's homework herself.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Early Concepts
I created a user storyboard based on my user persona: Emily who are going to use the tutor service app to schedule a private tutor quickly and easily.

<br>

![User Storyboard](/images/projects/bravo-tutor/storyboard.JPG)

<br>
<br>
<br>

### User Journey Mapping
I created a user journey map of Emily's experience to identify potential pain points and opportunities for improvement. This helped outline the steps from looking for a tutor to confirming a session and paying for it, revealing key moments where the experience could be optimized.

<br>
<br>

**Persona**: Emily Rose Harrington

**Goal**: Use an app to search and book time with a suitable private tutor for my children

## Design, Test, Iterate

### Initial Wireframing

I began by sketching paper wireframes for each screen in my app, keeping the user's needs for a fast booking process and easy navigation in mind. My goal was to create a seamless user flow for a simple and easy booking experience.

<br>

<br>
<br>

### Digital Wireframes

Moving to digital wireframes helped me visualize how the app would address user pain points and identify ways for improvements. Key screens included:
<br>
<br>

##### Homepage Design

- **Navigation:** Clean hamburger menu for easy access to all sections
- **Discovery:** Swiping carousel featuring tutor introduction videos
- **Browsing:** Organized list of tutor profiles with key information visible

<br>

<img src="/images/projects/bravo-tutor/digital_WF1.png" alt="Digital Wireframes" width="450px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
<br>
<br>

##### Tutor Profile Page

- **Information Display:** Majority of space dedicated to tutor details, qualifications, and reviews
- **Action Button:** Prominent "Reserve" button for quick booking initiation
- **Trust Building:** Reviews, ratings, and verification badges prominently displayed

<br>

<img src="/images/projects/bravo-tutor/digital_WF2.png" alt="Digital Wireframes" width="450px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

<br>
<br>

##### Scheduling Interface

- **Availability:** Clear view of tutor's available dates and times
- **Selection:** Intuitive date and time picker interface

<br>

<br>
<br>

##### Confirm Booking and Payment Flow

- **Booking Summary:** Clear confirmation page showing all booking details
- **Payment Form:** Dedicated page for personal and payment information

<br>

<img src="/images/projects/bravo-tutor/digital_WF5.png" alt="Digital Wireframes" width="450px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

<br>
<br>

##### Confirmation

- **Success State:** Clear confirmation that booking is complete
- **Next Actions:** Options to return home or book additional sessions

<br>

<br>
<br>

### Low-Fidelity Prototype

I connected all the digital wireframes to create a low-fidelity prototype, focusing on the primary user flow: finding a tutor, checking availability, scheduling, and completing payment. This step ensured the booking experience was smooth and easy to navigate.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Usability Testing

**Methodology**

I conducted an unmoderated usability study with 5 participants in Toronto to validate the initial design and identify areas for improvement.

<br>

### Key Findings

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Refining the Design
Based on the insights from usability study, I made several strategic changes based on users feedback to improve the user experience:

<br>

##### Improved Call-to-Action
- **Before:** Generic "Reserve" button that confused users
- **After:** Clear "Check availability" button that set proper expectations
- **Addition:** Added a heart-shaped "favorite" button for saving preferred tutors

<br>

<br>
<br>

##### Enhanced Scheduling Interface
- **Before:** Simple list of available times that was hard to parse
- **After:** Intuitive in-app calendar view with dropdown menus for hour selection
- **Result:** Much clearer visual representation of availability

<br>

<img src="/images/projects/bravo-tutor/before&after2.png" alt="Before and After Design Improvements" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

<br>
<br>

##### Complete Checkout Experience
- **Before:** Missing billing address fields
- **After:** Comprehensive payment form with all required information
- **Addition:** Added security indicators

<br>

### High-Fidelity Prototype

The final high-fidelity prototype incorporated all user feedback and design improvements while maintaining the same core user flow. The result was a polished, intuitive experience that successfully addressed all identified pain points.

## Accessibility & Inclusive Design

To ensure the app works for all users, I incorporated several accessibility features:

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Takeaways & Next steps

##### Key Results

Users found the final design to be intuitive, easy to use, and providing a seamless booking experience with clear visual hierarchy. The improvements successfully addressed all major pain points identified in initial testing.

<br>

##### What I Learned

This project reinforced that every small element of the design matters and can impact the entire user experience. The most important lesson was to always put the user front and center throughout the design process, using their feedback to guide every design decision.

<br>

##### Next Steps

To continue improving the Bravo Tutors experience, I would:

1. **Conduct follow-up usability testing:** Test the final design with different user group to validate improvements
2. **A/B Testing:** Test different versions of key screens to optimize conversion rates
