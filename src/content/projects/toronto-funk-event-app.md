## Toronto Funk - The Local Event Discovery App
**Toronto Funk** is a mobile application designed to solve the friction of finding and booking tickets for local events, festivals, and activities happening across the Greater Toronto Area. The focus is on providing a comprehensive, timely, and seamless discovery experience for active residents.

<br>

This project was completed as part of the exercise projects in the online course "Figma UI UX Design Essentials," where I applied the principles and techniques learned throughout the course.

<br>

##### Problem:

There is a significant gap in the market for a single, specific app that aggregates all current events, street festivals, and weekend activities in Toronto. People have to check many different sources, so they miss events and find it hard to plan spontaneous outings.

<br>

##### Solution:

Design a unified, visually engaging mobile platform that prioritizes timeliness and ease of search. The solution allows users to quickly browse, filter, and purchase tickets for events relevant to their location and interests, addressing the need for a dedicated Toronto event resource.

<br>
<br>

## Design & Key Features

**Target Users**: Active residents of Toronto, aged 18-55, who enjoy outdoor activities, street festivals, and live events. The design prioritizes bright, high-contrast UI elements to reflect the energy of the city's summer scene.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Key Screens Showcase

The final high-fidelity screens focused on four critical user flows: discovery, detailed viewing, filtering, and purchase.

<br>
<br>

##### 1. Discovery Home Screen

The primary view prioritizes "Happening Today" section. Category filters including "This Weekend" and "Newest" are immediately accessible to accommodate both browsing and specific searching behaviors.

<br>

##### 2. Event Detail View

The Event Overview page is designed for high conversion and clear information delivery. Key elements include sticky CTA button ("Buy Ticket"), clear display of date/time/location, event details and a vibrant hero image.

<br>
<br>

##### 3. Search and Filtering

A dedicated search experience allows users to filter by date range, price, and proximity. The goal was to eliminate scroll fatigue by providing powerful tools to narrow down the hundreds of potential events.

### High-Fidelity Prototype

The final prototype showcases the full visual design, interactions, and micro-animations, delivering a polished user experience.

## Takeaways & Next Steps

##### What I Learned

The primary challenge of the Toronto Funk app was managing and presenting a high volume of diverse information (festivals, concerts, street fairs, etc.) in a way that didn't overwhelm the user. This reinforced the importance of information architecture and hierarchy in mobile design. Using large, colorful cards for browsing and highly specific filters for searching ensured the app remained usable and engaging.

<br>

##### Next Steps

Future iterations would focus on user personalization, such as adding a "Recommended For You" feed based on past event purchases or saved interests to further reduce the effort required for event discovery.
